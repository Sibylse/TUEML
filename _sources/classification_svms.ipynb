Furthermore, for a given class of non-linear transformations, the number of possible features might quickly explode. For example, let us consider all polynomials of degree $K$. Thus, there are ${D + K - 1}\\choose {K}$ possible features to select -- with $D$ denoting the number of features in the original feature space $ {\\cal X}$ -- when designing the non-linear feature space ${\\cal Z}$.
