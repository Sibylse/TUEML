    "**Recap:** the performance of a particular decision tree  $ {\\cal T} $ depends on its structure -- branches from the root to the leaves -- and its content -- boolean functions / dimensions $ \\lbrace \\left( f_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}(\\cdot), d_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} \\right) \\rbrace $ assigned to the decision nodes $ \\lbrace \\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\rbrace $ and e.g. categorical distributions $ \\lbrace P_{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}}(\\cdot) \\rbrace $ assigned to the prediction nodes $ \\lbrace \\boldsymbol{\\ell} \\rbrace $. On the other hand, the structure and content of tree $ {\\cal T} $ are tightly coupled with the particular set $ {\\cal D} $ of training examples employed to build it. Therefore, the performance of two decision trees $ {\\cal T}^{(1)} $ and $ {\\cal T}^{(2)} $ built to perform the same classification task, but using slightly different datasets $ {\\cal D}^{(1)} $ and $ {\\cal D}^{(2)} $, might significantly differ. **Conclusion:** despite being quite easy for a human to interpret how a decision tree performs the classification task, a decision tree alone is not such a reliable classifier.\n",

We can also randomize the CART algorithm parameters. For example, we can select a particular set of features $ {\\cal F}^{(b)} \\subset \\lbrace 1, \\ldots, D \\rbrace $ to build each tree $ {\\cal T}^{(b)} $; and\n",
    "* **Aggregating:** for a particular observed sample $ \\check{\\bf x} $, we combine the estimates $ \\lbrace \\hat{y}^{(b)} \\rbrace $ provided by the ensemble $ {\\cal E} = \\lbrace {\\cal T}^{(b)} \\rbrace $, $ b \\in \\lbrace 1, \\ldots, B \\rbrace $, to produce a final estimate $ \\hat{y} $.\n",

    "Remember that, by assumption, the training dataset -- and also the testing dataset -- of the type $$ {\\cal D} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{N} \\lbrace \\left( {\\bf x}_{i}, y_{i} \\right) \\rbrace, $$ in which $ {\\bf x}_{i} \\in {\\cal X} $ and $ y_{i} \\in {\\cal Y} $, contains several ($ N \\gg 0 $) realizations of the random vectors / variables $ {\\bf X}, Y $ jointly distributed according to some unknown distribution $ p^{\\ast}({\\bf x}, y) $. Note that the prediction $ \\hat{y} $ provided by a trained classifier $ h:{\\cal X} \\rightarrow {\\cal Y} $ for an arbitrary feature vector $ \\check{\\bf x} $ -- i.e. a particular sample of the random vector $ {\\bf X} $ -- is a realization of the random variable $ \\hat{Y} = h({\\bf X}) $. Hence, the classifier prediction itself can be modeled as a random variable. Now, let the random variable\n",

Thus, a particular classification match $ z_{i} = \\left[ y_{i} = \\hat{y}_{i} \\right] $ with $ \\hat{y}_{i} = h({\\bf x}_{i}) $ committed by the classifier $ h (\\cdot) $ for the $i$-th data item $ {\\bf x}_{i} $ in $ {\\cal D} $ is a realization of the random variable $ Z $.

A similar analysis can be done for the testing classification error $ CE_{test} $ and accuracy $ ACC_{test} $.\n",

    "To summarize, the empirical training -- or testing -- performance metrics of a classifier $ h(\\cdot) $ are realizations of random variables which depend on the particular samples of the training -- or testing -- datasets.

As indicated in the figure, as the model complexity increases, the bias component always decreases and the variance component always increases when composing the testing prediction error. Specifically, as the model complexity starts increasing, we observe a decrease in the testing prediction error as the squared bias component quickly decreases. The testing prediction error continues to decrease as the model complexity gets higher, but at some point it starts increasing as the variance component gets too high due to model overfitting, i.e. the model starts overfitting the training data. In this case, despite fitting better and better to the training data, the model starts loosing its ability to properly generalize and deal with *unseen* samples from a testing dataset. Note though that the training prediction error always decreases as the model complexity increases. \n",

As the testing dataset $ {\\cal D}_{test} $ contains realizations of the unknown distribution $ p^{\\ast}({\\bf x}, y) $, the empirical error $ CE_{test}^{(b)} $ is also a realization of some random variable $ W_{b} \\sim p_{b}(w_{b}) $ with variance $ \\sigma_{b}^{2} = E_{W_{b} \\sim p_{b}} \\lbrace (W_{b} - \\mu_{b})^{2} \\rbrace  $ and mean $ \\mu_{b} = E_{W_{b} \\sim p_{b}} \\lbrace W_{b} \\rbrace $.

To summarize the discussion, for an arbitrary aggregation procedure, we write $$ \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\sigma_{b}^{2} \\leq \\sigma_{e}^{2} \\leq \\sigma_{1}^{2}, \\sigma_{2}^{2}, \\ldots, \\sigma_{B}^{2}, $$ i.e. the aggregation procedure reduces the variance associated with the individual classifiers leading to a more robust ensemble classifier in the sense its empirical error $ CE_{test} $ is less sensitive to the employed training and testing datasets: $ {\\cal D} $ and $ {\\cal D}_{test} $.
