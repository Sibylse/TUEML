    "### Feature space\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ {\\bf x} $ denote a feature vector residing in a multidimensional space $ {\\cal X} $ comprising several  features. We describe the data items -- i.e. the objects we are trying to classify -- by feature vectors in $ {\\cal X} $. Note that the vector $ {\\bf x} \\in {\\cal X} $ describing a given data item may comprise either continuous (e.g. length, height, weight) or discrete (e.g. color code) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class labels\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, let $ y $ be a discrete variable indicating the class label (target) among the set of possible labels $ {\\cal Y} $, where $ {\\cal Y} \\triangleq \\lbrace \\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ldots, \\ell_{L} \\rbrace $ is a finite set -- a.k.a. alphabet -- of $ L $ arbitrary labels. The variable $ y \\in {\\cal Y} $ indicates thus a class value (label) assigned to a data item. A label $ \\ell $ can be either the class name or a unique identification number / code representing the class. However, for the sake of simplicity, the class labels are usually normalized as indexes spanning e.g. from $ 0 $ to $ L-1 $. \n",

    "```{prf:remark}\n",
    "We should pick up the set of features according to the particular classification problem we are trying to solve and also make sure that it really encloses sufficient information to help distinguishing data items / objects from different classes. Note therefore that the selection of classes and the selection of features are often entangled.\n",

Specifically, the $ i $-th _known_ training example is represented by a pair $ {\\cal D}_{i} \\triangleq \\left( {\\bf x}_{i}, y_{i} \\right) $ including both the feature vector $ {\\bf x}_{i} $ and the associated class label $ y_{i} $. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:remark}\n",
    "As we increase the number of features (more dimensions) or the granularity of the existing features (e.g. more values per discrete feature), the classifier might increase its ability to distinguish training examples from different classes. However, besides possibly increasing the computational burden to deal with all input features, the required number of training examples might significantly increase to prevent over fitting.\n",
