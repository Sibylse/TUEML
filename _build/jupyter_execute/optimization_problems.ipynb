    "Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a vast, rugged mountain landscape. Your goal is to reach the lowest point in this terrainâ€”a hidden valley where the air is still. Easy, you might think. I'll just look at the map and see where the lowest point is. But what if the map is infinitely big? And what if the mountain landscape is in a high-dimensional hyperspace, where you can't see anything but three dimensional projections of this hyperspace? The optimization challenges in machine learning are a bit like that: the task to find the lowest valley an infinitely large space extending within hundreds of dimensions. What we need to solve this task is to get some hints where to look for the valley, and this is what optimization theory can deliver.\n",

    "You probably know from your highschool math classes that every local minimizer $x_0$ of a function $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a stationary point: $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x_0)=0$. This is known as the first order neccessary condition. This property is easily understood, considering that the derivative indicates the slope of a function at a specified point. If we have a real-valued minimizer, then the slope is zero at that minimizer. If the slope would be positive, then we can go to the left to decrease the function value further, and if the slope is negative, we can go to the right. By means of this property, we can identify all the candidates that could be minimizers. Maximizers and saddle points are stationary points too. With the second order neccessary condition, we can filter further the minimizers from the pool of candidates. The second order neccessary condition states that at a minimizer the second derivative is nonnegative $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x_0)\\geq 0$. The second derivative is the slope of the slope. If we have a minimizer, then the slope increases: first we go down, and then we go up. Hence, we need that the slope of the slope does at least not decrease. \n",

    "The principles of the first and second order conditions can be generalized to functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^d\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ mapping from a $d$-dimensional vector space to real values. The main difficulty is that we have now more to consider than just left and right when looking for a direction into which we could minimize the function further. In fact, any vector $\\vvec{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ could indicate a possible direction in which the function might decrease. Luckily, we can show that we just have to check one direction, given by the negative *gradient*, which points into the direction of steepest descent. The gradient indicates the slope of a function in the directions of the coordinates, which are called the *partial derivatives*. A partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f(\\vvec{x})}{\\partial x_i}$ is computed like a one-dimensional derivative by treating all variables except for $x_i$ as  a constant. The gradient gathers those partial derivatives in a vector. The transposed of the gradient is called the *Jacobian*.\n",
